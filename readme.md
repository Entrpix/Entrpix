# Abnormality
Well witness mе now, come, caress me now\
My "avеrage" clothes I'll wear no more!\
Break my cocoon, butterfly born anew\
I'll show everything In all its glory for you\
This stage, bitter cold, performs not a soul\
So I'll step to the beat with a 1, 2, 3\
I'm not a puppet at all, just dancing along!\
I am losing my mind!
